# BLOCKER REPORT

---

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Agent**: Implementation Agent
**Severity**: High

## Blocker Description

Cannot enable branch protection on private repo Xeyth-Labs/.xeyth via GitHub API: GitHub returns `403 Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make this repository public to enable this feature.` This blocks configuring required PR reviews, conversation resolution, and force-push/deletion restrictions.

## Impact

- Blocked Deliverables: D1-D6 (branch protection, PR review requirement, conversation resolution, force-push/deletion restrictions, verification)
- Partial Progress: Repository exists with remote and topics; branch protection not applied.

## Attempted Solutions

1. `gh api repos/Xeyth-Labs/.xeyth/branches/master/protection --method PUT ...` → 403 Upgrade to GitHub Pro or make repository public.
2. Re-run with same parameters (status checks contexts empty) → same 403.

## Recommendation

Upgrade organization to a paid plan that supports branch protection on private repositories (GitHub Team/Enterprise) or temporarily make the repository public (not recommended given current privacy requirement). After upgrading, re-run the `gh api .../protection` command or configure via Settings → Branches.
