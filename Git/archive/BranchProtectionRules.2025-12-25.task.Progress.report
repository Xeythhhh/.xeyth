# PROGRESS REPORT

---

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot
**Status**: In-Progress

## Summary

- Repository made public; branch protection tightened to 2 approvals with code owner required and admins enforced
- CODEOWNERS added (`* @Xeythhhh`) to ensure owner approval
- Conversation resolution enforced; force-push/deletion blocked; strict status checks enabled (contexts empty until CI exists)
- Task/README updated to reflect new rules; pending verification steps remain

## Deliverables

- [x] D1: Branch protection enabled
- [x] D2: PR reviews required (2 approvals incl. owner)
- [ ] D3: Status checks configured (contexts pending CI)
- [x] D4: Conversation resolution required
- [x] D5: Protection documented
- [ ] D6: Verification complete (need direct-push or CI validation)

## Verification

- `gh api repos/Xeyth-Labs/.xeyth/branches/master/protection` shows admins enforced, 2 approvals, code owner required, conversation resolution on, force-push/deletion blocked, strict status checks with empty contexts
- No direct-push attempt yet; no CI contexts to exercise status checks

## Next Steps

- Add CI status check contexts when pipelines exist, then reapply protection with contexts and mark D3/D6
- Perform a direct-push attempt to confirm protection enforcement and complete D6
- Optional: clean legacy markdownlint warnings in Git/README.md
