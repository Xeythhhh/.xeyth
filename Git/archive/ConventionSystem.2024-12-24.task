# Convention System Implementation

## Delegation Prompt

---

## Role: Implementer

**Task File**: Git/ConventionSystem.task  
**Objective**: Introduce `.convention` context file type and create commit convention

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Implementation.prompt.md](../Framework/Implementation.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Delegation Context

The framework needs a standardized way to document conventions (commit messages, code style, naming, etc.) that apply across the codebase. The `.convention` context file type will serve as enforceable standards that agents and developers follow.

### Responsibilities

1. Create the `Commit.convention` file with conventional commit standards
2. Document the `.convention` context file type in `Planning/ContextFiles.md`
3. Update workspace file associations to treat `.convention` as markdown
4. Ensure convention files are discoverable and referenced in delegation prompts

### Delegation Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: `Git/Commit.convention` created with conventional commit format specification
- [ ] **D2**: `.convention` type documented in `Planning/ContextFiles.md` with schema and usage
- [ ] **D3**: Workspace `.code-workspace` updated to include `*.convention: markdown` association

### Reports

- Keep status/blocker reports in separate `.report` files named `ConventionSystem.{ReportName}.report` alongside this task file
- Reference the report filenames here (do not inline full reports)
- Move reports together with the task when archiving/moving
- Use [Planning/ProgressReport.report.template](../Planning/ProgressReport.report.template) for status updates and [Planning/BlockerReport.report.template](../Planning/BlockerReport.report.template) when blocked

### Guidance

- Patterns: Follow Conventional Commits 1.0.0 specification (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- Verification: Markdown linting clean for all new files
- Critical notes: Convention files should be prescriptive, concise, and enforceable

### Upon Completion

1. Update Progress Log in this file (summaries only; link to `.report` files for details)
2. Use Flow prompt for continue/progress/blocker, and delegate using the 3-line format to the next role

## Task Details

---

### Convention System Implementation

Status: Complete  
Owner: Implementer  
Priority: High  
Effort: Small

## Objective

Introduce the `.convention` context file type to document enforceable standards across the framework, starting with commit message conventions.

## Task Context

- Current state: 
  - Framework has `.task`, `.plan`, `.report`, `.template` context files
  - No standardized way to document conventions
  - Git slice created but empty
  
- Desired state:
  - `.convention` files documented as a context file type
  - `Commit.convention` provides clear commit message standards
  - Workspace treats `.convention` as markdown
  - Convention files referenced in delegation workflows

## Task Deliverables

- D1: `Git/Commit.convention` - Conventional commit specification with types, scopes, format rules
- D2: `Planning/ContextFiles.md` - Updated with `.convention` section describing purpose, schema, location
- D3: `.code-workspace` - File associations updated to include `*.convention`

## Architecture Decisions

- AD-1: Use Conventional Commits 1.0.0 as the standard — Rationale: Industry standard, tool support, semantic versioning compatible
- AD-2: Place convention files in relevant slices — Rationale: Vertical slice architecture keeps conventions close to related code/prompts
- AD-3: Convention files are prescriptive, not descriptive — Rationale: Clear enforcement rules for agents and developers

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Markdown linting passes on all new files
- [ ] `.convention` type documented with clear schema and examples
- [ ] `Commit.convention` is comprehensive and actionable
- [ ] Workspace settings include `.convention` file association

## Progress Log

- 2024-12-24: Task created; Git slice and ConventionSystem.task scaffolded

  - Created Git/Commit.convention with Conventional Commits 1.0.0 spec
  - Updated Planning/ContextFiles.md with .convention type documentation
  - Updated .code-workspace with *.convention file association
  - All markdown linting clean
