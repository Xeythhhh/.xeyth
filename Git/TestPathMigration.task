## Objective

Create and execute a migration plan to align all test projects and fixtures under the `{Slice}/Tests/` directory convention across the repository.

- Ensure tooling and documentation reflect the new layout

## Deliverables

- [ ] D4: CI/test scripts adjusted for new paths
- [ ] D5: Documentation updated for test layout convention
