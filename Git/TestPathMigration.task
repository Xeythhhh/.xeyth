# Test Path Migration to Centralized Testing Convention

**Status**: Superseded  
**Owner**: Implementation Agent  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Effort**: Medium  

## Objective

~~Create and execute a migration plan to align all test projects and fixtures under the `{Slice}/Tests/` directory convention across the repository.~~

**Superseded by**: [Testing/TestOrganization.task](../Testing/TestOrganization.task)

This task was superseded by a framework-wide test reorganization that established a centralized `Testing/` directory structure instead of the originally proposed `{Slice}/Tests/` pattern.

## Resolution

Test projects were reorganized under a centralized `Testing/` directory with slice-based subdirectories:
- `Testing/Automation/` - Automation slice tests
- `Testing/Contracts/` - Contracts slice tests  
- `Testing/Git/` - Git slice tests
- `Testing/Shared/` - Shared test infrastructure

This approach provides:
- Better discoverability (all tests in one place)
- Clearer separation between tests and source code
- Consistent structure across all slices
- Foundation for shared test infrastructure

## Migration Completed

All test projects have been migrated:
- `Git/Tests/GitTool.Tests` → `Testing/Git/GitTool.Tests`
- `src/tests/Automation.*` → `Testing/Automation/`
- `src/tests/Contracts.*` → `Testing/Contracts/`

See [Testing/TestOrganization.convention](../Testing/TestOrganization.convention) for comprehensive test organization rules.

## Original Scope

- ~~Inventory existing test projects and utilities outside `{Slice}/Tests/`~~
- ~~Define migration steps per slice (Automation, Contracts, etc.)~~
- ~~Update solution/project references and CI scripts as needed~~
- ~~Ensure tooling and documentation reflect the new layout~~

## Deliverables (Completed in TestOrganization.task)

- [x] D1: Inventory report of current test locations (completed via analysis)
- [x] D2: Migration plan per slice with timelines (completed via TestOrganization.task)
- [x] D3: Updated solution and project references (completed)
- [x] D4: CI/test scripts adjusted for new paths (N/A - no changes needed)
- [x] D5: Documentation updated for test layout convention (TestOrganization.convention, Testing/README.md)

## Progress Log

- 2025-12-26: Task created to track test path convention migration
- 2025-12-27: Superseded by TestOrganization.task
- 2025-12-27: All test migration work completed under centralized Testing/ structure
