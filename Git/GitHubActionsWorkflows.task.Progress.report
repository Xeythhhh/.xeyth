# PROGRESS REPORT

---

**Date**: 2025-12-25
**Agent**: GitHub Copilot
**Status**: In-Progress

## Summary

- Added GitHub Actions workflows: Build (ubuntu-latest, ./build.sh Compile) and Test (matrix: ubuntu/windows/macos using Nuke commands)
- Updated branch protection required status checks to Build and Test while retaining 2-approval + code owner requirements and conversation resolution
- Documented workflows with badges in Git/README.md

## Deliverables

- [x] D1: Build workflow created
- [x] D2: Test workflow created
- [x] D3: Workflows trigger on push/PR (configured)
- [ ] D4: Status checks visible (await first run)
- [ ] D5: Branch protection updated with required checks (configured, pending validation after runs)
- [ ] D6: Workflows documented (badges added; broader doc OK, but lint warnings remain legacy)

## Verification

- Workflows not yet executed; Actions runs pending next push/PR
- Branch protection GET shows required_status_checks: Build, Test; approvals/code-owner/admins/conversation/force-push/deletion policies intact

## Next Steps

- Trigger workflows (push/PR) to validate Build/Test checks and mark D4/D5/D6 complete after successful runs
- Optionally address existing markdownlint warnings in Git/README.md
