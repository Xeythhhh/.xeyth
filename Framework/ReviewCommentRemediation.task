## Role: Implementer

**Task File**: Framework/ReviewCommentRemediation.task
**Objective**: Implement Copilot reviewer suggestions that were auto-resolved without addressing

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Implementation.prompt.md](Framework/Implementation.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Context

PRs #28 and #29 were merged after auto-resolving review threads WITHOUT implementing the suggestions. This violates code review principles and leaves known issues in the codebase.

**PR #28 Unimplemented Suggestions**:
1. Fix capitalization: "Pwsh" → "pwsh" in task file
2. Fix date typo: "2024-12-24" → "2025-12-24" in progress log
3. Fix task path reference in delegation section

**PR #29 Unimplemented Suggestions**:
1. Update error message to mention both "BREAKING CHANGE:" and "BREAKING-CHANGE:" formats
2. Add test case for "BREAKING-CHANGE:" hyphenated variant
3. Add test case for empty BREAKING CHANGE footer validation

### Your Responsibilities

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b task/review-comment-remediation`
2. Implement all suggestions from PR #28
3. Implement all suggestions from PR #29
4. Run full verification: build, tests, lint
5. Commit and push changes
6. Create PR referencing this task
7. Update progress log

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: PR #28 suggestions implemented
- [ ] **D2**: PR #29 suggestions implemented
- [ ] **D3**: All tests pass with new test cases
- [ ] **D4**: PR created and ready for review
- [ ] **D5**: Progress report created

### Implementation Guidance

**PR #28 Files to Fix**:
- `Automation/Automation/ScriptMigrationPhase2.task` (3 fixes)

**PR #29 Files to Fix**:
- Error message in commit validation code
- Test file for BREAKING-CHANGE variant
- Test file for empty footer validation

**Verification Steps**:
- [ ] `dotnet build` succeeds (0 errors, 0 warnings)
