# Model Requirements (Local Override)

For this local branch, roles are **model-agnostic**: a single agent may assume any role (Strategic, Implementation, Scaffold, Cleanup). Delegations **do not need to specify a model**. Keep role names for clarity, but model enforcement is disabled.

This override is scoped to the `local/custom` branch and is not intended for upstream.
