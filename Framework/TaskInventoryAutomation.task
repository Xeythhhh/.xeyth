## Role: Planner

**Task File**: Framework/TaskInventoryAutomation.task
**Objective**: Create CLI tool to automate task inventory management (Plans.inventory, .plan.Tasks.inventory)

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Strategic.prompt.md](Framework/Strategic.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Context

Task inventories (.plan.Tasks.inventory, Plans.inventory) are currently maintained manually. Need CLI tool to:
- Auto-detect new .task files and prompt for plan assignment
- Update inventories when tasks are archived
- Validate inventory consistency (all listed tasks exist, no orphans)
- Generate reports of task distribution across plans

### Your Responsibilities

1. Research task discovery and inventory management patterns
2. Design CLI architecture for inventory operations
3. Plan integration with existing xeyth-planning tool
4. Define validation rules and consistency checks

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: Research report on task discovery patterns
- [ ] **D2**: CLI command design (add-task, remove-task, sync-inventory, validate)
- [ ] **D3**: Architecture decisions (standalone vs xeyth-planning integration)
- [ ] **D4**: Validation rules documented
- [ ] **D5**: Implementation plan ready for delegation

### Verification Steps

- [ ] Plan complete and approved by Planner
- [ ] Ready for Implementation Agent delegation
