# Inventory System & GitHub Integration

## Delegation Prompt

---

## Role: Implementer

**Task File**: Framework/InventorySystem.task  
**Objective**: Introduce `.inventory` context file type and integrate framework with host `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Implementation.prompt.md](Implementation.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Delegation Context

The framework needs seamless integration with host repositories through `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and requires inventory files to track plans and their associated tasks for auditing and automation purposes.

### Responsibilities

1. Update `InitializeAiFramework.prompt.md` to create/modify `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in host repo
2. Introduce `.inventory` context file type with clear schema and purpose
3. Create `Planning/Plans.inventory` as a framework-level example
4. Update `Plan.plan.template` to enforce `{Plan}.Tasks.inventory` creation
5. Document inventory file structure and automation potential

### Delegation Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: `InitializeAiFramework.prompt.md` includes `.github/copilot-instructions.md` setup instructions
- [ ] **D2**: `.inventory` type documented in `Planning/ContextFiles.md` with schema
- [ ] **D3**: `Planning/Plans.inventory` created as framework example
- [ ] **D4**: `Plan.plan.template` updated with Tasks.inventory requirement
- [ ] **D5**: Workspace `.code-workspace` updated with `*.inventory: markdown` association

### Reports

- Keep status/blocker reports in separate `.report` files named `InventorySystem.{ReportName}.report` alongside this task file
- Reference the report filenames here (do not inline full reports)
- Move reports together with the task when archiving/moving
- Use [Planning/ProgressReport.report.template](../Planning/ProgressReport.report.template) for status updates and [Planning/BlockerReport.report.template](../Planning/BlockerReport.report.template) when blocked

### Guidance

- Patterns: Inventory files are line-based lists for easy parsing and automation
- Verification: Markdown linting clean for all new files
- Critical notes: Plans reside at slice root; tasks can be distributed; inventory tracks relationships

### Upon Completion

1. Update Progress Log in this file (summaries only; link to `.report` files for details)
2. Use Flow prompt for continue/progress/blocker, and delegate using the 3-line format to the next role

## Task Details

---

### Inventory System & GitHub Integration

Status: Complete  
Owner: Implementer  
Priority: High  
Effort: Medium

## Objective

Enable seamless host repository integration via `.github/copilot-instructions.md` and introduce inventory tracking for plans and tasks to support auditing and automation.

## Task Context

- Current state: 
  - Framework lacks integration mechanism with host repos
  - No systematic tracking of plan-to-task relationships
  - Plans and tasks mixed without clear audit trail
  
- Desired state:
  - Host repos automatically reference framework via `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
  - `.inventory` files track plans and their associated tasks
  - Plans at slice root with `{Plan}.Tasks.inventory` for automation
  - Clear separation: `.plan` = scope/decisions, `.task` = work items

## Task Deliverables

- D1: `InitializeAiFramework.prompt.md` - Add step to create `.github/copilot-instructions.md` referencing framework
- D2: `Planning/ContextFiles.md` - Document `.inventory` type with format, location, usage
- D3: `Planning/Plans.inventory` - Framework-level inventory listing all active plans
- D4: `Plan.plan.template` - Add Tasks.inventory requirement and guidance
- D5: `.code-workspace` - Add `*.inventory` file association

## Architecture Decisions

- AD-1: Use `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for integration — Rationale: GitHub Copilot's standard discovery mechanism
- AD-2: Plans reside at slice root, tasks distributed — Rationale: Plans are slice-scoped; tasks are feature/component scoped
- AD-3: Inventory files are line-based lists — Rationale: Easy parsing for automation, simple manual editing
- AD-4: Each plan maintains `{PlanName}.Tasks.inventory` — Rationale: Explicit plan-to-task mapping for auditing and tooling

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Markdown linting passes on all new files
- [ ] `.inventory` type fully documented with examples
- [ ] `Plans.inventory` tracks framework plans
- [ ] Plan template enforces Tasks.inventory creation
- [ ] Workspace settings include `.inventory` association
- [ ] InitializeAiFramework includes GitHub integration step
