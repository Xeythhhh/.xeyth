## Role: Planner

**Task File**: Framework/CopilotCloudAgentConfiguration.task
**Objective**: Research and document Copilot Cloud agent configuration for optimal framework integration

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Strategic.prompt.md](Framework/Strategic.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Context

GitHub Copilot Cloud agents (both Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GPT-5.1-Codex-Max) may require configuration to:
- Access MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers for enhanced context
- Install global tools (gh CLI, dotnet tools, etc.) in prebuilt environments
- Configure workspace settings and environment variables
- Enable automatic agent invocation and delegation
- Set up persistent state across agent sessions

### Your Responsibilities

1. Research GitHub Copilot Cloud agent architecture and configuration options
2. Investigate MCP server requirements and setup
3. Document global tool installation capabilities (gh CLI, xeyth-* tools)
4. Explore environment customization and persistence
5. Identify automatic agent invocation capabilities

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: Research report on Copilot Cloud agent architecture
- [ ] **D2**: MCP server configuration requirements (if applicable)
- [ ] **D3**: Global tool installation options (prebuilt vs. runtime)
- [ ] **D4**: Environment customization capabilities
- [ ] **D5**: Agent invocation and delegation mechanisms
- [ ] **D6**: Configuration guide with examples

### Implementation Guidance

**Research Areas**:
- GitHub Copilot documentation for cloud agents
- MCP protocol specification and server setup
- Devcontainer configurations for Copilot agents
- GitHub Actions runner customization
- Agent-to-agent communication patterns

**Key Questions**:
1. Does Copilot Cloud agent support MCP servers?
2. Can we preinstall gh CLI in agent environments?
3. Is there a `.github/copilot-agent-config` or similar?
4. Can agents invoke other agents programmatically?
5. How do agents persist state across invocations?
6. What environment variables are available?

### Verification Steps

- [ ] Plan complete and approved by Planner
- [ ] Ready for Implementation Agent delegation

## Task Details

---

Status: Not Started
Owner: Strategic Agent (Planner)
Priority: High
Effort: Small
Priority Score: 9 (Impact:7 + Urgency:3 + Dependency:5 - Complexity:0 - Unblocks automation)

## Objective

Research GitHub Copilot Cloud agent configuration to enable full framework automation.

## Task Context

- Current state: Unknown configuration requirements for Copilot Cloud agents
- Desired state: Documented configuration enabling automatic agent invocation, gh CLI access, MCP integration

## Research Questions

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- Does GitHub Copilot Cloud support MCP servers?
- How to configure MCP servers for cloud agents?
- Can MCP provide repository context, documentation, APIs?

### Global Tools
- Can we preinstall gh CLI in Copilot Cloud environments?
- How to install dotnet global tools (xeyth-planning, xeyth-contracts, etc.)?
- Are tools persistent across agent sessions?

### Environment Customization
- Is there a configuration file for agent environments?
- Can we set environment variables (GITHUB_TOKEN, etc.)?
- How to customize PATH and other shell settings?

### Agent Invocation
- Can Strategic Agent invoke Implementation Agent programmatically?
- What tools/APIs enable agent-to-agent communication?
- How to pass context between agents?

### Workspace Persistence
- How do agents access workspace files?
- Is git state preserved across invocations?
- Can agents commit/push to branches?

## Success Criteria

- [ ] MCP configuration documented (or N/A if unsupported)
- [ ] Global tool installation guide complete
- [ ] Environment customization options documented
- [ ] Agent invocation mechanisms identified
- [ ] Configuration examples provided
