## Role: Planner

**Task File**: Framework/ProposalWorkflowEnhancement.task
**Objective**: Streamline proposal creation from Implementation Agent ideas during PR work

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Strategic.prompt.md](Framework/Strategic.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Context

Implementation Agents often discover optimization opportunities during work but must manually create proposal files. Need automation to:
- Parse PR comments for @copilot proposal tags
- Auto-generate proposal files from structured comments
- Link proposals to originating PR/task for traceability
- Notify Orchestrator of new proposals in backlog

### Your Responsibilities

1. Research proposal capture patterns (GitHub PR comments, code comments, chat)
2. Design proposal template with metadata (origin PR, author, submitted date)
3. Plan automation for proposal file creation
4. Define integration with xeyth-planning tool

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: Research report on automated proposal capture
- [ ] **D2**: Enhanced proposal template with origin tracking
- [ ] **D3**: CLI command design (create-proposal, link-pr)
- [ ] **D4**: GitHub integration plan (PR comment parsing)
- [ ] **D5**: Implementation plan ready for delegation

### Verification Steps

- [ ] Plan complete and approved by Planner
- [ ] Ready for Implementation Agent delegation
