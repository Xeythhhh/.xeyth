## DELEGATION PROMPT

````markdown
**Task**: [Build/PerformanceOptimization.task](Build/PerformanceOptimization.task)
**Role**: Planner (see [Framework/Strategic.prompt.md](../Framework/Strategic.prompt.md))
**Target Audience**: Strategic Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

Plan build performance optimizations - incremental builds, parallel compilation, caching strategies.
````

## Role: Planner

**Task File**: Build/PerformanceOptimization.task
**Objective**: Optimize build performance for faster development cycles

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Strategic.prompt.md](../Framework/Strategic.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Context

Build performance can be improved via:
- Incremental builds (only rebuild changed projects)
- Parallel compilation (multi-core utilization)
- NuGet package caching
- Test assembly caching
- Nuke build caching

### Your Responsibilities

1. Research .NET build optimization techniques
2. Measure current build performance (baseline)
3. Design optimization strategy (incremental, parallel, caching)
4. Plan Nuke build pipeline enhancements

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: Research report on .NET build optimization
- [ ] **D2**: Build performance baseline measurement
- [ ] **D3**: Optimization strategy design
- [ ] **D4**: Nuke pipeline enhancement plan
- [ ] **D5**: Caching strategy (local + CI)
- [ ] **D6**: Implementation plan

### Verification Steps

- [ ] Plan complete and approved by Planner
- [ ] Ready for Implementation Agent delegation
