# Copilot Cloud Agent Instructions

Use the existing instruction system for this repository:

- Project-specific rules: [.github/copilot-instructions.md](./copilot-instructions.md)
- Framework rules and roles: [Ai/Framework/copilot-instructions.md](../Ai/Framework/copilot-instructions.md)

Always load these instruction files before starting work so the Copilot coding agent follows the established workflows and quality gates.
