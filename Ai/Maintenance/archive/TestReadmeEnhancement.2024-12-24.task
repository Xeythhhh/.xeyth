# README Enhancement Test Task

---

## Delegation Prompt

---

## Role: Implementer

**Task File**: Maintenance/TestReadmeEnhancement.task  
**Objective**: Add usage quick-start section to main README as a workflow validation test

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Implementation.prompt.md](../Framework/Implementation.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Delegation Context

This is a test task to validate the framework's delegation and workflow patterns. We'll enhance the main README with a quick-start section to help new users get started faster.

### Responsibilities

1. Review current README.md structure
2. Add a "Quick Start" section after the overview
3. Keep it concise and actionable

### Delegation Deliverables

- [x] **D1**: Quick Start section added to Ai/README.md
- [x] **D2**: Section includes 3-5 actionable steps for new users

### Reports

- Keep status/blocker reports in separate `.report` files named `TestReadmeEnhancement.task.{ReportName}.report` alongside this task file
- Reference the report filenames here (do not inline full reports)
- Move reports together with the task when archiving/moving
- Use [Planning/ProgressReport.report.template](../Planning/ProgressReport.report.template) for status updates and [Planning/BlockerReport.report.template](../Planning/BlockerReport.report.template) when blocked

### Guidance

- Patterns: Keep the quick start focused on the most common first actions
- Verification: Markdown linting clean
- Critical notes: This is a test task - focus on validating workflow, not perfection

### Upon Completion

1. Update Progress Log in this file (summaries only; link to `.report` files for details)
2. Use Flow prompt for continue/progress/blocker, and delegate using the 3-line format to the next role
3. When complete, archive to `Maintenance/archive/TestReadmeEnhancement.YYYY-MM-DD.task` and update relevant inventories

## Task Details

---

Status: Complete  
Owner: Implementer  
Priority: Medium  
Effort: Small

## Objective

Add a Quick Start section to the main README to validate framework workflows and improve user onboarding.

## Task Context

- Current state:
  - README exists with structure overview
  - No quick-start guidance for new users
  - Need to test framework task workflows

- Desired state:
  - Quick Start section added to README
  - New users can get started in 3-5 clear steps
  - Framework workflow validated through real task completion

## Task Deliverables

- D1: Quick Start section in Ai/README.md with clear formatting
- D2: 3-5 actionable steps for new framework users

## Architecture Decisions

- AD-1: Place Quick Start early in README — Rationale: Users need quick wins before diving into details
- AD-2: Keep it minimal — Rationale: Test task should be simple to validate workflow, not comprehensive

## Success Criteria

- [x] Quick Start section exists in Ai/README.md
- [x] Section has 3-5 clear, actionable steps
- [x] Markdown linting passes
- [x] Task workflow successfully followed from creation to archive

## Progress Log

- 2024-12-24: Test task created as part of DogfoodFramework.task (D3)
- 2024-12-24: Quick Start section added with 5 actionable steps; all deliverables complete
