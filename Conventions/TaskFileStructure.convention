# Task File Structure

## Convention Summary

All `.task` files MUST follow a standardized structure with delegation prompt section at the top, followed by task details, architecture decisions, and progress tracking. This ensures consistent task management and enables agents to work autonomously.

## Rules

### File Structure

- ✅ MUST start with delegation prompt section (between `---` separators)
- ✅ MUST include Task Details section with metadata
- ✅ MUST include Objective section
- ✅ MUST include Success Criteria section
- ✅ MUST include Progress Log section
- ✅ SHOULD include Architecture Decisions when applicable
- ❌ MUST NOT mix unrelated tasks in single file

### Delegation Prompt Section

- ✅ MUST appear before task details
- ✅ MUST include Role, Task File, Objective
- ✅ MUST include Context explaining why task exists
- ✅ MUST include Responsibilities list
- ✅ MUST include Deliverables with acceptance criteria
- ✅ SHOULD include Implementation Guidance
- ✅ SHOULD include Verification Steps

### Task Details Section

- ✅ MUST include: Status, Owner, Priority, Effort
- ✅ MUST calculate Priority Score when applicable
- ✅ MUST use consistent status values: `Not Started`, `In Progress`, `Complete`, `Blocked`
- ✅ MUST use priority values: `Critical`, `High`, `Medium`, `Low`
- ✅ MUST use effort values: `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`

### Progress Log

- ✅ MUST use format: `YYYY-MM-DD: {Note}`
- ✅ MUST record key decisions and status changes
- ✅ MUST link to separate `.report` files (not inline full reports)
- ✅ SHOULD note verification evidence

## Examples

### ✅ Good Example - Task File Structure

```markdown
# Task Name

---

## Delegation Prompt

---

## Role: Implementer

**Task File**: Slice/TaskName.task  
**Objective**: One-line objective

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Implementation.prompt.md](...)

### Context

Why this task exists and what it unlocks

### Your Responsibilities

1. Responsibility 1
2. Responsibility 2

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: Acceptance criteria
- [ ] **D2**: Acceptance criteria

### Implementation Guidance

**Patterns to Follow**: {Links to examples}

#### Verification Steps

- [ ] Build passes
- [ ] Tests pass

---

## Task Details

---

Status: Not Started  
Owner: Implementer  
Priority: High  
Effort: Medium  
Priority Score: 10

## Objective

Detailed objective description

## Task Context

- Current state: {bullets}
- Desired state: {bullets}

## Task Deliverables

- D1: {Description and acceptance}

## Architecture Decisions

- AD-1: {Decision + rationale}

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Build succeeds
- [ ] Tests pass

## Progress Log

- 2024-12-25: Task created
```

### ❌ Bad Example - Missing Structure

```markdown
# Some Task

We need to do X because Y.

TODO:
- Thing 1
- Thing 2

Started 2024-12-25
```

**Problems**:
- No delegation prompt
- No structured deliverables
- No success criteria
- Informal format

## Validation

### Manual Verification

- [ ] Delegation prompt section exists between `---` separators
- [ ] All required sections present (Objective, Deliverables, Success Criteria, Progress Log)
- [ ] Status is one of valid values
- [ ] Priority Score calculated (if applicable)
- [ ] Progress Log uses date format YYYY-MM-DD
- [ ] Report files linked (not inlined)

### Automated Verification

```bash
# Validate task file format
xeyth-planning validate-task {path}

# List all tasks
xeyth-planning list-tasks

# Check for missing required sections
xeyth-contracts validate --path {task} --strict
```

### CI/CD Integration

Contract validation runs in PR pipeline:
```bash
xeyth-contracts validate --path . --strict
```
