**Task**: [Testing/TestOrganization.task](Testing/TestOrganization.task)
**Role**: Planner (see [Framework/Strategic.prompt.md](../Framework/Strategic.prompt.md))
**Target Audience**: Strategic Agent (Claude Sonnet 4.5)

Plan test organization strategy - currently tests scattered across slices, need consistent structure and naming conventions.

## Role: Planner

**Task File**: Testing/TestOrganization.task
**Objective**: Define test organization strategy for consistent structure across all slices

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Strategic.prompt.md](../Framework/Strategic.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Context

Tests are currently organized per-slice (Automation/tests, Contracts/tests, Git/tests). Need:
- Consistent naming conventions (unit, integration, E2E)
- Shared test infrastructure (fixtures, builders, utilities)
- Architecture validation tests (NetArchTest)
- Test categorization and filtering strategy

### Your Responsibilities

1. Research test organization patterns (.NET, xUnit best practices)
2. Design directory structure and naming conventions
3. Plan shared test infrastructure location
4. Define test categories and tagging strategy

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: Research report on test organization patterns
- [ ] **D2**: Directory structure conventions documented
- [ ] **D3**: Naming conventions for test projects/classes
- [ ] **D4**: Shared infrastructure design (test utilities, fixtures)
- [ ] **D5**: Test category taxonomy (unit, integration, architecture, E2E)
- [ ] **D6**: Implementation plan for migration

### Verification Steps

- [ ] Plan complete and approved by Planner
- [ ] Ready for Implementation Agent delegation
