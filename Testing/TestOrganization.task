## Role: Implementer

**Task File**: Testing/TestOrganization.task
**Objective**: Reorganize test projects and establish consistent test organization conventions

**Role Reference**: See [Framework/Implementation.prompt.md](../Framework/Implementation.prompt.md) for workflow guidance.

### Context

Tests are currently scattered across multiple locations (Git/Tests/, src/tests/). Need to consolidate into Testing/ directory with consistent structure and naming conventions.

### Your Responsibilities

1. Move test projects to Testing/ directory organized by slice
2. Create test organization convention document
3. Update solution file and project references
4. Verify builds and tests still pass

### Deliverables

- [x] **D1**: Test organization convention document created
- [x] **D2**: Directory structure established (Testing/Automation/, Testing/Contracts/, Testing/Git/, Testing/Shared/)
- [x] **D3**: All test projects moved from Git/Tests/ and src/tests/ to Testing/
- [x] **D4**: Project references updated to reflect new paths
- [x] **D5**: Solution file updated with new test project locations
- [x] **D6**: Build verification (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] **D7**: Test verification (all tests passing)

### Verification Steps

- [x] Build passes: `dotnet build` (0 errors, 0 warnings)
- [x] All tests pass: `dotnet test`
- [x] Convention document created and comprehensive
- [x] Task file updated with completion status
