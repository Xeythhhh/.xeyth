4. Define ADR workflow (creation, review, superseding)

### Deliverables

- [ ] **D1**: Research report on ADR systems
- [ ] **D2**: ADR template design
- [ ] **D3**: Directory structure and naming
- [ ] **D4**: ADR workflow guidelines
- [ ] **D5**: Integration plan (link from code/docs)
- [ ] **D6**: Implementation plan

### Verification Steps

- [ ] Plan complete and approved by Planner
- [ ] Ready for Implementation Agent delegation
