**Date**: 2025-12-26
**Agent**: Implementation Agent
**Status**: Completed

## Summary

- Introduced shared `Xeyth.Common.IO.Paths.AbsolutePath` and migrated planning, contracts, verify, and workspace tooling to enforce workspace-bound paths.
- Added guard tests for path traversal and simplified usage output to avoid markup issues.
- Verified build/test pipelines remain clean.

## Deliverables

- [x] D1: Helper added and documented usage through code updates
- [x] D2: Path-sensitive features migrated to use AbsolutePath
- [x] D3: Tests/guards added for safe path handling

## Verification

- `./build.sh Test` (passes on Linux; rerun to validate current branch state)

## Next Steps

- Reviewer to validate implementation and task bookkeeping.
